* "Classifying optical microscope images of exfoliated graphene flakes by data-driven machine learning," Satoru Masubuchi and Tomoki Machida, npj 2D Materials and Applications volume **3**, Article number: 4 (2019) 
* "Deep-Learning-Based Image Segmentation Integrated with Optical Microscopy for Automatically Searching for Two-Dimensional Materials," Satoru Masubuchi *et al.*, (under review)

The codes are based on the implementation of Mask R-CNN by (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image.
