# Mask R-CNN for 2D Materials Detection
This repository provides information for utilizing Deep-learning based image segmentation algorithms for detecting atomically thin two-dimensional materials in the optical microscopy images. The related publications are: 

* "Autonomous robotic searching and assembly of two-dimensional crystals to build van der Waals superlattices," Satoru Masubuchi *et al.*, Nature Communications **9**, Article number: 1413 (2018). 
* "Deep-Learning-Based Image Segmentation Integrated with Optical Microscopy for Automatically Searching for Two-Dimensional Materials," Satoru Masubuchi *et al.*, (under review)

We also provide the training datasets, and trained model weights though the permanent link at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.xxxxxxxx

The codes are based on the implementation of Mask R-CNN by (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. 

## Remarks
I hope to continue developing 2DMMS to become a truly helpful tool for the research community of van der Waals heterostructures. Please feel free to email me with your feedback or any issues at: msatoru@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp
