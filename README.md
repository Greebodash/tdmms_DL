# Mask R-CNN for 2D Materials Searching
This is a pfoject for automated searching and assembly of two-dimensional materials into van der Waals superlattices. Information on the research can be found in the following publications:


The codes are based on implementation of Mask R-CNN by (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.
